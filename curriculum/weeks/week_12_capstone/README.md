# Week 12: Capstone Project & Interview Prep

## Overview
Bring everything together in a full-stack capstone project that showcases your skills. Build a production-ready application from scratch while preparing for technical interviews with algorithms, system design, and behavioral questions.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement a complete full-stack application
- Apply best practices from all previous weeks
- Prepare for technical interviews (coding, system design, behavioral)
- Build a portfolio-worthy project
- Practice problem-solving under constraints

## Week Structure

### Days 1-3: Capstone Project
Build a full-stack application with:
- **Frontend**: React with modern hooks and state management
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express REST API with authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with migrations and relationships
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Deployment**: Dockerized and deployed to cloud
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, architecture diagrams

### Days 4-5: Interview Preparation
- **Algorithms**: Common patterns and data structures
- **System Design**: Scalability, databases, caching
- **Behavioral**: STAR method, common questions
- **Live Practice**: Mock interviews and code challenges
