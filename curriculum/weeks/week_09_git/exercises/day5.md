# Day 5: Team Simulation — Exercises

Goal: Simulate a mini sprint with issues, branches, PRs, reviews, and a release.

Tasks:
1) Create 3 issues (feature A/B, bugfix C). Link branches to issues in commit messages (e.g., `feat: add A (#123)`).
2) Implement each on a separate branch and open PRs with descriptions and checklists.
3) Review each PR (self or peer), request changes, push updates, and merge.
4) Use Conventional Commits for all messages. Generate a basic changelog section for this release.
5) Create a release tag `v1.0.0` after merging. Push tags.
6) Draft a release note including highlights and breaking changes (if any).

Deliverables:
- List of PRs (or simulated merges) with links or notes.
- Changelog snippet and commands used for tagging and pushing.
