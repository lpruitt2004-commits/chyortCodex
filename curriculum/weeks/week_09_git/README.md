# Week 9: Git & Collaboration

## Overview
Master Git workflows used on real teams: clean commits, branching strategies, rebasing safely, resolving conflicts, working with remotes and pull requests, and diagnosing history.

## Learning Objectives
- Use Git confidently for day‑to‑day development
- Create clean atomic commits and readable history
- Branch, merge, and rebase without losing work
- Work with remotes, PRs, and code review feedback
- Diagnose issues with bisect, revert, and cherry‑pick

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Git Fundamentals
- Initialize repo, stage/commit, .gitignore
- Inspect history: log, diff, show
- Undo with care: restore, reset (soft/mixed/hard) — theory

### Day 2: Branching & Merging
- Branch strategies: feature branches
- Fast‑forward vs merge commits
- Resolve merge conflicts; rebase basics (safe usage)

### Day 3: Remotes & PR Workflow
- Clone, remotes (origin/upstream), fetch/pull/push
- Tracking branches, PR lifecycle, code review etiquette

### Day 4: Advanced Git
- Interactive rebase (reorder/squash/fixup)
- Cherry‑pick, revert, stash, worktree
- Tags and releases

### Day 5: Team Simulation
- Multi‑feature workflow, conflict resolution
- Conventional commit messages, changelog basics
- Hooks and CI pre‑checks (format/test)

## Week Project: Team Feature Sprint
Simulate a small team sprint:
- Create issues for 3 features and 1 fix
- Implement each on its own branch
- Submit PRs, review feedback, merge
- Produce a release tag and changelog snippet

## Try It
Each day has an exercise (`exercises/dayX.md`) and a solution (`solutions/dayX.md`) with example commands and expected outputs.
