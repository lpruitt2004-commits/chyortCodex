# Week 4 React Exercises

React exercises require a different setup than HTML/CSS/JS exercises.

## Setup

Each day's exercise will be a small Vite + React project.

To create a new exercise:

```bash
npm create vite@latest day1 -- --template react
cd day1
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Structure

- `day1/` - React basics & JSX
- `day2/` - useState practice
- `day3/` - useEffect practice  
- `day4/` - React Router
- `day5/` - Context API

## Alternative

You can also practice React concepts in CodeSandbox or StackBlitz online:

- https://stackblitz.com/

Create a new React template and follow the README instructions for each day.
