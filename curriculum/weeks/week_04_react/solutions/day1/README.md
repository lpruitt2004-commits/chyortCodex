# Week 4 – Day 1 Solution: Components, JSX & Props

This project contains the completed solution for Day 1 of React Fundamentals.

## What Was Implemented
- Functional components (`Welcome`, `UserCard`, `ProductList`, `Badge`, `Navbar`)
- Prop destructuring and default rendering
- List rendering with stable `key` usage
- Conditional rendering for optional props
- Basic styling in `App.css`

## Try It
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open: http://localhost:5173

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – Production build
- `npm run preview` – Preview production build
- `npm run lint` – Run ESLint

## Learning Highlights
Compare this with the exercise version to see:
- Prop-driven rendering patterns
- Reusable UI primitives
- Separation of sample data from component logic
- Proper key usage in lists

## Next Step
Proceed to Day 2 (State & Events) to introduce interactivity with `useState`.
